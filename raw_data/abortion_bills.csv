AR,H1195,"Targeted regulation of abortion providers; In February, Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) signed a bill (H1195) creating a state program that provides information on pregnancy-related services. People seeking abortion care are required to contact the program and be offered pregnancy support, parenting resources, and care coordination; the program cannot refer them to abortion services. Prior to receiving payment for or performing an abortion, providers must report each patient to a state database and record an assigned resource consultation ID in the patient’s medical record. Providers must also report each abortion within two business days of its completion. In addition, the law requires at least annual random, unannounced audits of at minimum 10% of abortion facility and provider records. The law is scheduled to take effect in January 2023.",Clinic Regulation,Enacted
AR,H1402,"Targeted regulation of abortion providers; In April, Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) approved a measure (H 1402) that requires providers of medication abortion to follow a state-mandated protocol rather than the one recommended by the Food and Drug Administration or a medical organization. Under the state’s protocol, medication abortion must be provided in-person, and patients must receive a physical examination prior to receiving the medication. Physicians must also schedule an in-person follow-up after the abortion is complete. In addition, the measure requires medication abortion providers to have an emergency transfer agreement with a hospital or have an agreement with another provider who does. The law is scheduled to take effect in July.",Clinic Regulation,Enacted

The physician must also provide verbal and written counseling about medication abortion “reversal.” An image from an ultrasound, which is mandated, must be offered to the patient for free, and the provider must include a copy of the ultrasound report in the patient’s file. In addition, abortion reporting to the state must include the location where the pregnant person received counseling and provided consent.

It also requires the provider to verify the pregnancy and conduct blood tests before a medication abortion, requiring the patient to make a trip to the clinic before a 72-hour waiting period already in effect begins. The provider must also be able to handle emergencies related to medication abortion or have a contract with another physician who can provide this care.

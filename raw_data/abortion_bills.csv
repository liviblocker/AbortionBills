OK,S778,"In May, Gov. Kevin Stitt (R) signed legislation (S 778) that limits access to and provision of medication abortion. The measure reinforces existing law that only a physician can provide medication abortion and also prohibits the mailing of the pills necessary for the procedure. It also requires the provider to verify the pregnancy and conduct blood tests before a medication abortion, requiring the patient to make a trip to the clinic before a 72-hour waiting period already in effect begins. The provider must also be able to handle emergencies related to medication abortion or have a contract with another physician who can provide this care. In addition, the patient will be required to receive counseling on, and consent in writing to, the medication abortion. This counseling must provide unverified information on medication abortion “reversal,” including the unproven idea that reversing a medication abortion does not increase the risk of maternal mortality. (Currently counseling related to reversing a medication abortion is not in effect because of a pending court case.) The law also requires reporting requirements for each medication abortion that includes the types of medication used, information on complications and payment information. The law is scheduled to go into effect in November.",Reporting Requirements,Enacted
OK,S779,"In May, Gov. Kevin Stitt (R) signed legislation (S 779) that requires the State Board of Pharmacy, the State Board of Medical Licensure and Supervision, and the State Board of Osteopathic Examiners to establish certification requirements for providing medication abortion. The regulations, which restate the state’s ban on telehealth for medication abortion, limit distribution of medication abortion pills to those providers participating in the program and prohibit mailing of the pills necessary for the procedure. Providers are required to verify the patient’s pregnancy in-person and to provide the patient with information about medication abortion, including unverified information that reversing a medication abortion does not increase genetic anomalies in the fetus or increase the risk of maternal mortality. The law prohibits providing medication abortion after 10 weeks of pregnancy. It also requires providers to either have admitting privileges at a hospital in the same county as the abortion facility or an adjacent county, or to have an agreement with a physician who has those privileges. Providers are also required to report medication abortions, including the types of medication used and information on any complications.

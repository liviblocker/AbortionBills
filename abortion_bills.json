Asa Hutchinson (R) signed a bill (H1195) creating a state program that provides information on pregnancy-related services. People seeking abortion care are required to contact the program and be offered pregnancy support, parenting resources, and care coordination; the program cannot refer them to abortion services. Prior to receiving payment for or performing an abortion, providers must report each patient to a state database and record an assigned resource consultation ID in the patient’s medical record. Providers must also report each abortion within two business days of its completion. In addition, the law requires at least annual random, unannounced audits of at minimum 10% of abortion facility and provider records. The law is scheduled to take effect in January 2023.",

   "Description": "In June, Gov. Mike DeWine (R) signed the state’s budget (H 110), which includes $25 million for maternal and child health and $3 million for abortion alternatives, as well as statutory provisions on sex education, refusal to provide medical services and abortion. The budget requires the state to expand Medicaid coverage for one year postpartum (an increase from 60 days). Schools must notify parents when a sex education class includes any instruction besides the abstinence programming that is required by state law. The budget also prohibits the state Board of Education from adopting regulations on sex education that differ from state law and requires the state Department of Education to audit sex education programs each year. The law also includes an expansive refusal clause that allows medical providers, medical institutions and health insurers to refuse to provide any treatment or service as a result of religious, moral or ethical beliefs. In addition, an abortion clinic that wants to be granted a waiver from the requirement that it have a transfer agreement with a local hospital must have an arrangement with a physician who has privileges at a hospital within 25 miles of the clinic. The money for maternal and child health and alternatives to abortion services is for each of the next two fiscal years. The 2022 fiscal year started in July.",

It also requires the provider to verify the pregnancy and conduct blood tests before a medication abortion, requiring the patient to make a trip to the clinic before a 72-hour waiting period already in effect begins. The provider must also be able to handle emergencies related to medication abortion or have a contract with another physician who can provide this care. In addition, the patient will be required to receive counseling on, and consent in writing to, the medication abortion. This counseling must provide unverified information on medication abortion “reversal,” including the unproven idea that reversing a medication abortion does not increase the risk of maternal mortality. (Currently counseling related to reversing a medication abortion is not in effect because of a pending court case.) The law also requires reporting requirements for each medication abortion that includes the types of medication used, information on complications and payment information.

Providers are required to verify the patient’s pregnancy in-person and to provide the patient with information about medication abortion, including unverified information that reversing a medication abortion does not increase genetic anomalies in the fetus or increase the risk of maternal mortality. The law prohibits providing medication abortion after 10 weeks of pregnancy. It also requires providers to either have admitting privileges at a hospital in the same county as the abortion facility or an adjacent county, or to have an agreement with a physician who has those privileges. Providers are also required to report medication abortions, including the types of medication used and information on any complications. The law is scheduled to take effect in November.",
